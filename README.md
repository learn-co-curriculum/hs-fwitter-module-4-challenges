## Week 4 Challenges!

+ We desperately need your help building an online store for our Flatiron Swag! Take a look at the Flatiron Swag lab in the Database section and start building out another project. 
+ Take a look at the Direct Messages lab that walks through setting up a table for direct messages. This is a tough one because you'll need to set up a join table that tracks users aliased as senders and receivers.
+ Check out the Ruby Labs section of Ironboard - remember work from top to bottom because they get harder as you go along.

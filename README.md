## Week 4 Challenges!

+ Read up on ActiveRecord validations (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) and set up validations for the length of tweets and for the uniqueness of a userâ€™s email address.
+ Check out the lab for building out a customers table for the Flatiron swag store app. 
+ Take a look at the stretch lab that walks through setting up a table for direct messages. This is a tough one because you'll need to set up a join table that tracks users aliased as senders and receivers.
